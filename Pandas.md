# Why Pandas?

  -  ## 1 Data Manipolation
  - ## 2 Data Analysis

## 1 Data Maniplation

Manipolation of data is the process of manipulatinig or changing
information to make it more organozed and readable.

    ## pandas   

 ## 2 Data Manipulation

- ## Purpose:
   - Consistant Data
   - Project related data
   - Create more value for data
   - Remove or Ignore Data

 ### RAW Data --> 
- step1. Data collection/loading.
- step2. Data clean.
- step3. Data filltration.
- step4. Data remove up/ignore.
- step5. Data joining/raking/tidy up.
- step6. Data joining/merging.
- step7. Data splitting.
- step8. Missing value found.
- step9. Duolicate value remover.
- step10. Image analysis.
     
            --> Cleane Data(become readable),
               Data Analysis,
               Make some grapes,
               Then repoting,
               And presentation.

## 2 Data Analysis

- Virtual part of a bisiness
- Learn and adapt( Nokia , Samsung , Apple)
- Data driven decision making( CODANICS Youtube)
- Data driven policy making(Methan Emission, polutino etc..)
- How many likes and responses?
- Should I continue this course?
- how international we are?
- How good is our modle?
- Should we ban diesel car? or improve more gas car?
- Persent of people
- Engineering work performances

## Types of Data Analysis

1.Discriptive analytics: What happened?

2.Diagnostic analytics:  Why did it happen?

3.Predictive analytics: What is likely to happen in the future?

4.Prescriptive analytics: What is the best course of action to take?

# Pandas - vs - Ms Excel
- Data Frame  ----Worksheet
- Series-----------Colums
- Index-----------Row Heading
- Row------------Row
- NaN------------Empty Cell

         -> Load,read ,prepare,model and analyze data
         -> Join,merge,filter,reshape
         -> Data from different databases and join in one
         -> Anything with data
